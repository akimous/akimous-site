		<h1>Linter and Beautifier Integration</h1>
		<p>
			Akimous integrates with tools like Pyflakes and Pylints to capture potential problems in your code. A spell checker is also built-in. All warnings are displayed in the linter panel without bothering you in the code editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			YAPF and isort are automatically executed to beautify the code when you save it.
